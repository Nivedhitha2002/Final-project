# Enhancing Lane Detection in Challenging Weather Condition

Description:
Developed a robust lane detection system using OpenCV, capable of accurately identifying lane markings in adverse weather conditions. Improves reliability and safety of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).

Key Features:

- Color selection for filtering lane markings
- Region of Interest (ROI) for optimized processing
- Hough transform for line detection
- Gaussian blur for image smoothing
- Grayscale conversion for enhanced contrast

Technologies: OpenCV, Computer Vision, Python
